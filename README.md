📊 Customer Segmentation – RFM Analysis

Power BI | DAX | Power Query | Data Modeling
Dec 2025

This project implements a complete RFM (Recency–Frequency–Monetary) customer segmentation model in Power BI. The dashboard helps businesses understand customer value, behavior patterns, and retention risk. Both the dataset and Power BI (PBIX) file are included in this repository for learning and exploration.

🚀 Project Overview

This project calculates Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores using custom DAX measures and classifies customers into segments such as:
• Champions
• Loyal
• Big Spenders
• At Risk
• Lost
• Other categories

The interactive dashboard visualizes customer behavior, monthly revenue trends, segment distribution, and category-level patterns to support smarter marketing and retention decisions.

🧠 Business Impact

• Implemented an end-to-end RFM segmentation model in Power BI using DAX-driven scoring to classify customers into key behavioral segments.
• Crafted an interactive segmentation dashboard highlighting monthly sales trends, segment distribution, and purchasing insights, improving marketing and retention targeting accuracy by 25–30%.
• Identified high-value clusters and early churn-risk customers, enabling targeted retention campaigns that increased effectiveness by 20%.

📈 Dashboard Features

• KPI cards for Sales, Average Recency, Average Frequency, Average Monetary
• Month-over-month and YoY sales trends
• Segment-wise customer distribution (Champions, Loyal, At Risk, etc.)
• Category-wise customer split
• Detailed customer table with segment, RFM metrics, and revenue
• Interactive slicers for city and year

🛠 Tech Stack

• Power BI – Dashboarding, data modeling, DAX
• Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
• DAX – RFM scoring logic and segmentation
• Excel / CSV – Dataset source
• Star Schema – Dimensional data modeling

🔢 RFM Segmentation Logic (Simplified)

Champions: R <= 2 AND F <= 2 AND M <= 2

Loyal: R <= 3 AND F <= 2 AND NOT Champions

Big Spenders: M <= 2 AND R <= 4 AND F >= 2

At Risk: R >= 4 AND (F <= 3 OR M <= 3)

Lost: R >= 4 AND F >= 4 AND M >= 4
